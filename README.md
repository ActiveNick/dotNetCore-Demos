# dotNetCore-Demos
A collection of samples used to demonstrate development with [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net) and [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/) Core in my conference &amp; meetup tech talks. .NET is the development platform used by millions of developers to create apps and services on any device and OS, with amazing performance and great developer productivity. .NET Core and ASP.NET Core give you a blazing fast open source and modular platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac.
