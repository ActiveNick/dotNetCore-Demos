# dotNetCore-Demos
A collection of samples used to demonstrate development with [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net) and [ASP.NET](http://www.asp.net/) Core in my conference &amp; meetup tech talks. .NET is the development platform used by millions of developers to create apps and services on any device and OS, with amazing performance and great developer productivity. .NET Core and ASP.NET Core give you a blazing fast open source and modular platform for creating server applications that run on Windows, Linux and Mac.

## Samples
* **HelloWorld**: Basic console app that shows how to call libraries and share code.
  * *HelloWorld* is the console app that calls the other libraries listed below.
  * *HelloWorld-Lib* is a simple .NET Core Library (which is actually a .NEt Standard 1.6 library).
  * *OpenWeatherMap-PCL* is a PCl converted to a .NET Standard 1.4 library that can be called from .NET Core, UWP, .NET 4.6.1, and Xamarin.iOS & Xamarin.Android, making it the best way to share code across the board.
  * *HelloWorld-UWP* is a simple UWP client that calls the OpenWeatherMap-PCL library too, demonstrating code sharing.
* **HelloWorldWideWeb**: Basic ASP.NET Core MVC project with Bootstrap (in progress).
